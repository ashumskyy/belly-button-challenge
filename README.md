# belly-button-challenge

### The data from: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json";

In this challenge we used the D3 library to create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. 

We also created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

As the next step we displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
It showed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page in the Demographic Info panel.

We made possible for a user to update all the plots when a new sample is selected. 

At last, we deployed the app to the GitHub Pages.
